* EYE
# Pupillary light reflex. Optic properties of the eye: reflective surfaces, reduced eye, accommodation. Aqueous humour. Functions of the pigment epithelium: light reflection, removal of photoreceptor discs, the retinoid cycle. Phototransduction and adaptation to light/dark. Sensitivity, velocity and acuity of rods and cones systems. Visual pigments for colour vision. The receptive field of on-centre and off-centre ganglion cells, detection of luminosity contrast, the effect of background illumination.


** Pupillary light reflex
*** miosis & mydriasis
    - related to symphatatic & parasymphatatic
*** Reflex pathway; retina > pretectum > Edinger-Westphal nucleus > ciliary ganglion > pupillary constrictor muscles
    - direct & consensual response


** Optic properties of the eye
*** reflective surfaces
    - travel of light from source to retina
*** reduced eye
    - average of refractory index simplifies to single lens
*** accommodation
    - change of refractive power makes the lens focus
**** accommodation reflex
     - contraction of the ciliary muscle
     - suspensory ligaments' tension adjust curvature of lens
**** accommodation range
     - elasticity of fibers changes with age & accommodation range on graph decreases
     - 50 cm are 2 diopters
**** refractive errors
     - emmetropia
     - myopia
     - hyperopia
*** Aqueous humor
    - continuously cycled & secreted
    - pressure due to aqueous humor is imp. for correct curve
    - pressure = secretion - reabsorption, delicate balance
**** Canal of Schlemm
     - with veins reabsorption takes place
*** Retina
    - w/o instr. seen black, ophthalmoscope is needed, bcs entering light into eye absorbed
    - fundus
**** Optic disk
     - aka /papilla/, optic nerve w retinal blood vessels, aka /blind spot/

**** fovea


** Phototransduction
*** Embriogenesis of human eye
*** Structure of retina
    - photoreceptors are the last layer, even carrying nerves exposed to light
*** Vertical & Horizontal pathway
*** Pigment Epithelium
    - captures light as pigments are black
